Description: Creates ISO-9660 CD-ROM filesystem images
 genisoimage is a pre-mastering program for creating ISO-9660 CD-ROM 
 filesystem images, which can then be written to CD or DVD media using
 the wodim program. genisoimage includes support for making bootable
 "El Torito" CDs, as well as CDs with support for the
 Macintosh HFS filesystem.
 .
 The package also includes extra tools useful for working with ISO images:
  * mkzftree - create ISO-9660 image with compressed contents
  * dirsplit - easily separate large directory contents into disks of
    predefined size
  * geteltorito - extract an El Torito boot image from a CD image
 .
